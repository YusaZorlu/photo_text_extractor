# photo_text_extractor app
It extracts text from image and saves image URI with that text and you can search images with search bar or with another image with gallery.
Used Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, ROOM, ML Kit and Glide for project.
Use it with device with camera to use saving image with camera feature
Database sometime overwrites old image when I add a new image to db
and I need to make better Id generation to fix it
